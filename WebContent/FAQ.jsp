	<p><b>2. Why are we seeking plasma donations from people who've recovered from coronavirus?</b></p>
	<p>Historically, convalescent plasma has been used as a potentially lifesaving treatment in some situations when new diseases or infections develop quickly, and no treatments or vaccines were available yet. 

Convalescent plasma is plasma collected from patients who have recovered from an infection and have antibodies that might help fight that infection
in this case patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19. More recently, some information suggests that convalescent plasma could help some coronavirus patients especially those who are seriously ill.</p>

	<p><b>3. What is plasma?</b></p>
	<p> Plasma is the liquid portion of your blood. It helps with clotting and supports immunity. 
It contains antibodies that fight off infections, so those who have recovered from this new coronavirus will have antibodies in their blood plasma that help protect them against future infections.
</p>

	<p><b>4. How often can convalescent plasma donors give?</b></p>
	<p>*  Eligible individuals can donate their COVID-19 plasma with us as often as every seven days for up to three months donating a maximum of eight times. 

	Prior convalescent plasma donations made within the standard donation interval period of 28 days, do not count toward the eight donations or three-month totals.</p>
	<p>*  After three months or eight donations  whichever comes first  the donor will be deferred from all types of blood donations for six months.

	<p><b>7. How much plasma can an individual give safely?</b></p>
<p>*  The amount of plasma that can be safely donated is based on your weight and amount of red blood cells in your body. Our apheresis machine or cell separator carefully calculates

this at each donation to ensure the donors safety. With each donation, COVID-19 survivors may now have a unique ability to help up to four patients recover from the virus.</p>

<p>*  Individuals who have fully recovered from a verified COVID-19 diagnosis can sign up to donate by completing Donate Plasma Form.</p>
<p>*  During a plasma donation, blood is drawn from an arm and sent through a high-tech machine that collects your plasma and then safely and comfortably returns your red cells back to you, along with some saline. 
Because of this process, donating plasma does take longer than a regular whole blood donation. To help meet the growing need for this product to treat COVID-19 patients, eligible individuals can donate their convalescent plasma with us every seven days for up to three months.</p>
